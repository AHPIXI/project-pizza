### code/index.js

In order to simplify the execution of this project, we have provided you with an example that shows the structure of this file. In this initial step of our learning journey with JavaScript, we're exploring the alert() method. This method is like a pop-up message box that appears on your screen. Imagine you've entered a virtual pizza place called the "JavaScript Pizzeria." The code you see is like a script that tells the computer to show you a message in that pop-up box.

The message itself is written between the parentheses of the alert() method. It's enclosed in backticks (`) which allow us to include multiple lines of text and even special placeholders like ${} to insert dynamic content.

The message itself says, "Welcome to our JavaScript Pizzeria. This little program will run without needing to mess around with fancy website parts or special functions. It's all about helping you learn. Ready to begin? Click 'OK' to start."

So, when you run this code, a pop-up will appear on your screen with this message, inviting you to start your journey in a fun and interactive way. This is just the beginning of using JavaScript to make things happen on a webpage!

```js
alert(
  `Welcome to our Javascript Pizzeria. 
This little program will be executed without the neccesity of using DOM Elements or functions in order to enhance your knowledge, Readt to Start? - Click 'OK' to begin.`
);
```
