## Navigating this repository

In this project, we're all about mastering vital JavaScript tricks â€“ variables, conditionals, and native methods. The fun part? We've ditched web page fuss, giving you a pure coding playground.

Why? So you can nail the basics without distractions. Dive into JavaScript logic and amp up your variable game (they're like data containers!) and unleash conditionals for smart choices. You'll even groove with native methods for slick operations.

Bottom line: we're crafting a solid learning experience. Focus on JavaScript's core and skip the DOM maze. With this groundwork, you'll strut into tougher coding quests like a JavaScript champ. ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ

### code/index.html

To simplify the execution of this project, we've set up a basic webpage structure here. It's designed for our "JavaScript Pizzeria". The elements within the `<body>` tag are key components:

1. An `<h1>` tag featuring the text "Javascript Pizzeria": This prominent heading serves as the title of our webpage, indicating its association with our JavaScript-centered pizzeria project.

2. A `<p>` tag displaying the text "Logic is executed automatically": Within this paragraph element, a succinct explanation is given. It informs us that the series of instructions, or logic, will be carried out automatically during the webpage's loading.

3. A `<script>` tag with a `src` attribute linked to "script.js": This is where the real action unfolds. The `<script>` tag's purpose is to incorporate external JavaScript code. By utilizing the `src` attribute, we specify that the JavaScript instructions are stored within a file named "script.js".

In this manner, our project's foundation is established, setting the stage for the JavaScript magic that is about to unfold!

### code/script.js

In order to simplify the execution of this project, we have provided you with an example that shows the structure of this file. In this initial step of our learning journey with JavaScript, we're exploring the alert() method. This method is like a pop-up message box that appears on your screen. Imagine you've entered a virtual pizza place called the "JavaScript Pizzeria." The code you see is like a script that tells the computer to show you a message in that pop-up box.

The message itself is written between the parentheses of the alert() method. It's enclosed in backticks (`) which allow us to include multiple lines of text and even special placeholders like ${} to insert dynamic content.

The message itself says, "Welcome to our JavaScript Pizzeria. This little program will run without needing to mess around with fancy website parts or special functions. It's all about helping you learn. Ready to begin? Click 'OK' to start."

So, when you run this code;

```js
alert(
  `Welcome to our Javascript Pizzeria. 
This little program will be executed without the neccesity of using DOM Elements or functions in order to enhance your knowledge, Readt to Start? - Click 'OK' to begin.`
);
```

A pop-up will appear on your screen with this message, inviting you to start your journey in a fun and interactive way. This is just the beginning of using JavaScript to make things happen on a webpage!
